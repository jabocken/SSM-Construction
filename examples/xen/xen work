Lower priority: determining likely timeout causes, getting accurate edge counts
- can you write a short paragraph on time-out, e.g. to what time was the time out set? Was it same for binaries and library functions? What issues caused a time out?
- Why is xenctx such a significant outlier, that it takes 8.5 hours instead of 65 seconds? What is going on there? <- profiled it as well as qemu-nbd-xen for comparison, bit I'm not sure what to look for.

To examine for failure causes:
libxenlight (<fourteen timeouts to look at) <- current timeout is 14:30 hours

To examine to determine exact causes of unresolved jump causes, maybe:
libxenctrl
libxenguest
libxenlight
libxenstat
libxentoolcore
libxlutil




Building xen from source; using all default options after dep installs

    ./configure
    make world # equiv. to `make clean && make dist`, apparently

Using

    objdump -M intel -M hex --no-show-raw-insn -d

to disassemble.
